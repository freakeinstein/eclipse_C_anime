# eclipse_C_anime


### ECLIPSE:


An old project I've done, when I'm got introduced to C graphics. This is a graphics animation / music video created using basic Cpp (graphics.h in dev cpp). To setup dev cpp and stuff, go [here](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/bgi/dev-c++/). 

### Final Result: 

I've used a video editor to match it with a BGM as you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LdwhOEwMiU) in Youtube. 

### Inspiration:

This work is highly inspired by Lon Lucin's [work](https://vimeo.com/39792837) as seen in Vimeo and Behance.
